# Genomics Project - Bioinformatics Portfolio

This folder contains DNA genomics scripts for my bioinformatics portfolio. Each script is organized into subfolders according to its purpose:

- **alignment/**: DNA alignment workflows (BWA, Bowtie2, Minimap2, BLAST)  
- **variant_calling_annotation/**: Scripts to call and annotate SNPs/indels  
- **coverage_qc_analysis/**: Coverage calculation and sequencing quality analysis  
- **fastq_bam_qc/**: Raw FASTQ and BAM quality control  
- **reference_indexing/**: Indexing reference genomes for alignment tools  
- **simple_genome_subsetting/**: Extract specific chromosomes or regions  
- **file_conversion_compression/**: Convert and compress BAM/FASTA/VCF files  
- **visualization_prep/**: Prepare files for visualization in IGV or genome browsers

Each subfolder has its own README describing its scripts in detail.
