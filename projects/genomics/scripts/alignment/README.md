# Alignment Scripts

This folder contains scripts to align DNA sequencing reads to a reference genome.

Scripts included:

- **align_bwa.sh**: Align reads with BWA MEM and output sorted/indexed BAM  
- **align_bowtie2.sh**: Align reads with Bowtie2  
- **align_minimap2.sh**: Align reads with Minimap2  
- **align_blast.sh**: Align sequences with BLAST for small-scale or demo datasets

Each script works on the mock trial dataset and demonstrates proper alignment, sorting, and indexing of BAM files.
